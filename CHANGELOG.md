## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **DedupHandler** — suppresses repeated identical messages per time window;
  when a message passes again, the count of suppressed copies is attached as
  the `dedup_suppressed` attribute. Lock-free fixed-bucket counters, optional
  bypass level, `Stats()`, and `Builder.WithDedup` integration.
- **ConsoleHandler** — human-readable development handler: compact
  timestamps, colored three-letter level tags (respects NO_COLOR), dotted
  group keys, ambiguous values quoted. slogtest-compliant.
- **expvar adapters** — `PublishAsyncStats`, `PublishSampleStats`,
  `PublishDedupStats` expose handler counters on `/debug/vars` using only the
  standard library.
- **Benchmark smoke step in CI** — all benchmarks compile and run on every
  push; numbers printed for trend eyeballing (deliberately not an assertion
  gate — see ROADMAP.md).
- **ROADMAP.md** — records deferred features (redaction presets/value
  scanning, Prometheus module, network sinks, benchmark gate) with rationale,
  plus permanent non-goals.

- **Burst sampling** — `WithBurstSampling(interval, first, thereafter)`:
  within each window the first N records per unique message always pass,
  then every M-th. Lock-free fixed-bucket counters; guarantees rare events
  are never fully sampled out.
- **`SamplingHandler.SetLevelRate`** — update per-level rates at runtime
  (levels fixed at construction to keep the hot path lock-free).
- **`Find[T]`** — generic helper to locate a handler (concrete type or
  interface) inside a middleware chain, e.g. to read `AsyncHandler` stats.
- **`ModuleConfig.Levels` / `DefaultLevel`** — copy-snapshot of configured
  component levels for admin endpoints and debugging.
- **Fuzz tests** for the `SetLevels` spec parser and redaction path, run in CI.

### Changed

- CI now runs a matrix (Linux with race detector + fuzz, Windows) instead of
  Linux only.
- Chain traversal (`Close`/`Flush`/`Find`, including `MultiHandler` children)
  is bounded to 100 unwrap levels, so a degenerate cyclic `Unwrap` chain can
  no longer loop forever.
- `AsyncHandler.CloseContext` documents that its deadline does not bound the
  initial close signal when a `Block`-policy producer is stalled by a stuck
  sink.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-04

Initial release.

### Added

- **AsyncHandler** — non-blocking logging via a background worker with
  configurable buffer size, three drop policies (`DropNewest`, `Block`,
  `SyncFallback`), synchronous bypass for critical levels, deterministic
  `Flush` barrier, graceful `Close` with full drain, and runtime `Stats()`.
- **RedactionHandler** — sensitive data masking by exact key, dotted group
  path, regex pattern, or custom function; recursive group inspection.
- **SamplingHandler** — probabilistic and per-level sampling with a
  never-sampled bypass level and lock-free runtime rate updates.
- **ModuleHandler / ModuleConfig** — per-component log level filtering with
  runtime hot-reload.
- **MultiHandler** — fan-out to multiple handlers with error aggregation and
  lifecycle propagation through wrapped children.
- **Builder** — fluent composition of the middleware chain in a safe,
  fixed topological order.
- **Lifecycle** — `Close`/`Flush` (and context variants) that traverse the
  entire middleware chain via `Unwrap()`.
- **Exit / Fatal** — process-termination helpers that flush and close the
  handler chain before exiting, so buffered async records are never lost.
- **Context helpers** — `NewContext` / `FromContext` for the request-scoped
  logger pattern; `FromContext` falls back to `slog.Default()` and tolerates
  a nil context.
- **`Unwrapper` interface** — formalizes the `Unwrap() slog.Handler` contract
  so third-party middleware can participate in lifecycle traversal.
- **`ModuleConfig.SetLevels`** — parse and apply a level spec string such as
  `"database=debug,auth=warn,*=info"`; validated atomically, easy to wire to
  env vars, config files, or admin endpoints.
- **Self-redacting types** — `Redacted` and `SensitiveBytes`.
- **Attribute helpers** — `Err`, `Component`, `TraceID`, `SpanID`.
- Core constructors `New`, `NewJSON`, `NewText` with functional options.
